# Salesforce Commerce Cloud Adyen Cartridge

Adyen provides a LINK cartridge to integrate with Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC). This cartridge enables a SFCC storefront to use the Adyen payment service. This cartridge supports SFRA version 4.0.0 and SiteGenesis JS-Controllers.

## Integration
The cartridge integrates Secured Fields for all card payments. Local/redirect payment methods are integrated with Checkout API. For Point Of Sale (POS) payments in SiteGenesis, we use Terminal API using Cloud-based communication.
